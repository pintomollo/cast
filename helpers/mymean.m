function [all_mvals, all_svals, all_nelems] = mymean(all_vals, dim, indexes)
% MYMEAN computes the mean and standard deviation of the provided data along any
% dimension, ignoring NaNs. It also offers the possibility to provide a grouping
% vector to perform these measurements separately on each subset.
%
%   [MEAN] = MYMEAN(VALS) computes the average of VALS along the first non-singleton
%   dimension.
%
%   [...] = MYMEAN(VALS, DIM) computes the average of VALS along dimension DIM.
%
%   [...] = MYMEAN(VALS, DIM, GROUP) computes the average separately in each GROUP.
%   GROUP should be a vector the same length as the number of elements along DIM,
%   each similar value defining the members of a given GROUP.
%
%   [MEAN, STD] = MYMEAN(...) returns in addition the standard deviation.
%
%   [MEAN, STD, NPTS] = MYMEAN(...) also returns the number of considered points,
%   in each dimension/group depending on the required measurements.

  % Initialize some variables
  all_mvals = all_vals;
  all_svals = NaN;
  groups = [];

  % Get the size of the original matrix
  vals_size = size(all_vals);

  % Check if the provided dimension makes sense
  if (nargin == 2)
    if (dim > numel(vals_size))
      return;

    % Put all data in the same group
    else

  % Get the default behavior

    dim = find(vals_size > 1, 1);

  % Finally, check again if the dimension makes sense
  elseif (nargin == 3)

  % The whole trick to be flexible, is that we always work along the first dimension,
  % on a 2D array. We simply permute and reshape our data accordingly !

  % Create the permutation index

  perm_dim(dim) = 1;

  % Permute and reshape in 2D our data such that the measures can be made alond the
  % first dimension !

  % We linearize the indexes as we are now working along the first dimension !

  % Loop over each group

    mvals = sum(vals, 1) ./ nelems;

    % Replace the NaNs where they belong

    % Store the final output

    % Compute the standard deviation only if required
    if (nargout > 1)

      % Same trick here, we do the measurement manually to remove the NaNs.
      svals = bsxfun(@minus, vals, mvals).^2;

      % And replace the NaNs where they belong
      svals(nelems == 0) = NaN;
      svals(nelems == 1) = 0;

      % And store the results
      all_svals(i, :) = svals;
