Hi !

These set of tools (so-called Cell Tracking Plateform) have been
developed to provide an intuitive and easy-to-use interactive approach
for cell tracking and image quantification. These functions have been
developped and tested using Matlab R2012b on Mac OS X. In addition,
tests using Windows 7 should provide cross-platform support. These functions
make use of (at least) the Image Processing Toolbox (v. 8.1).

A number of functions have been implemented in C for speedup (located in ./MEX),
hence a C/C++ compiler is required (see http://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers/).

For compatibility among microscopy file types, the Bio-Formats conversion toolbox from
LOCI is also required (http://loci.wisc.edu/software/bio-formats). However, its
download will be attempted automatically during the installation procedure. In case of
failure, one should place the Bio-Formats command-line tools (bftools.zip), along with
the LOCI library tools (loci_tools.jar) in a folder "cell-tracking/bftools".

To install the Cell Tracking Plateform, change your Matlab working directory to this
"cell-tracking" one (either using the command-line "cd", or using the corresponding
button on Matlab's interface) and run "install_cell_tracking".

For an example on how to use this plateform, please read README.txt.

Happy tracking !
